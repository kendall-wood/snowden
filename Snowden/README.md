# Snowden - Stealth Game

A 2D top-down stealth game with government surveillance dystopia theme and architectural blueprint aesthetics.

## 🎮 How to Run the Game

### Option 1: Simple Double-Click (Easiest)
1. Navigate to the game folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. It should open in your default web browser

### Option 2: Specific Browser
1. Right-click `index.html`
2. Select "Open With" → Choose your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

### Option 3: Drag and Drop
1. Open your web browser
2. Drag `index.html` into the browser window

## ✅ What You Should See

If everything is working correctly, you should see:
- A black screen with green "SNOWDEN" title
- Text saying "Phase 1: Foundation Complete"
- A blinking green cursor (▮)
- The browser console should show success messages

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If you see a blank screen:
1. Open browser console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
2. Check for error messages
3. Make sure you have internet connection (Phaser.js loads from CDN)

### If nothing loads:
- Try a different browser
- Check that all files are in the correct location:
  ```
  Snowden/
  ├── index.html
  └── js/
      └── game.js
  ```
